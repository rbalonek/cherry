# Cherry Project

I was given two weeks to put together a website for this company based on images and descriptions they described to me based off of some other sites that inspired them. 

# MVP
- Header that randomly chooses text from a database of quotes that clients provide. 
- Header with backgroud image that is randomly generated from a database and matches the background of the opened hamburger menu as well. 
- Arrows in place of cursor that point in direction of navigation or carousel. A + and X for opening / closing modal with project information
- Links to metadata on images that bring you to a masonry page of projects that match keywords. 
- Smooth scroll / Scroll Snap when possible
- full screen carousels of highlighted projects.
- Password protected "B-sides" area.
- Full CRUD on projects (I used airtable for now as the database but was planning on moving to Ruby on Rails once they decided on final product.)

#Result
The clients were happy but put the website on hold for now but agreed to keep it up so I can showcase in my work.
